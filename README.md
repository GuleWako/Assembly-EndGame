# Assembly EndGame

**Assembly EndGame** is a React-based word-guessing game where players attempt to save programming languages from being eliminated by "Assembly." The player has 8 attempts to guess the correct word. For every incorrect attempt, a programming language is "killed" in the game. The ultimate goal is to guess the word correctly within 8 attempts to "save" the programming language.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Gameplay** : Players guess the word within 8 attempts.
* **Programming Language Stakes** : Incorrect guesses lead to the elimination of programming languages.
* **Compete with Assembly** : The player competes against "Assembly" to save the programming language.
* **Built with React** : The game leverages React's state management and component architecture for seamless gameplay.

## How to Play

1. Start the game, and a word will be randomly selected.
2. The player has 8 attempts to guess the word.
3. For each incorrect guess, a programming language is "killed."
4. If the word is guessed within 8 attempts, the player saves the programming language.
5. If all 8 attempts are used without guessing the word, the programming language is eliminated, and Assembly wins.
